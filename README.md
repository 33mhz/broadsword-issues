# broadsword-issues

Feel free to submit any bugs or feature requests/suggestions here.

Broadsword is a Firefox browser add-on, and a multi-column web page in Firefox or Chrome to view your feed and get desktop notifications from App.net. It has thread view, hashtags, user view, cleansed Global, your stream and mentions, Patter rooms, Netstomp events, private messages, and Broadcasts, with desktop notifications.

Go to https://broadsword.io to add the Firefox Service, or https://broadsword.io/go to use it as a web page.

App.net is an unusually conversational, international and heavily tech-focused little social network with [cookies](http://appdotnetwiki.net/w/index.php?title=Cookie_Club), [dance parties](http://mndp.tv/), and [free accounts](https://join.app.net/) (and paid accounts!).
